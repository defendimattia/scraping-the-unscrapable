# Scraping the Unscrapable

This project is a small Python exercise focused on web scraping, with the goal of exploring how to collect data from websites that aren’t designed to be easily scraped.

## Objectives
- Experiment with different scraping techniques (Requests, BeautifulSoup, CSS selectors, etc.)
- Handle common challenges found in “hard-to-scrape” websites (dynamic HTML, inconsistent structure, basic protections).
- Extract and organize data in a clean and reusable format.
